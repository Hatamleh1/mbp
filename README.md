# Mathematical foundations of algorithms

This course is devoted to mathematical aspects laying at the basis of major programming theories.
                                                        
In this course we will cover the following fundamental topics:
- Number representation in computer
- Linear algebra basics: vectors and matrices. And their role in computations.
- Graphs and trees.
- Algorithm complexity analysis. Big-O notation.
- Algorithmic strategies with connection to programming:
  - Recurrence relations and recursion in programs.
  - Brute force and it's practical improvements. 
  - Heuristic algoritms.
  - Greedy algorithms and matroids.
- Formal models.
  - Finite State Automata.
  - Languages and Grammatics.
